# Performance Analysis — `profiling/canvas.py`

**Workload:** 4 × `random_walkers` canvases, each 30×30 pixels rendered as half-block chars
(30×15 Chunks per canvas = 450 Chunks × 4 = ~1,800 Chunks total), all walkers moving every frame.
**Dataset:** 500 log lines, 50 complete render cycles, ~0.82 s wall time.
**Result:** Median cycle 15.7 ms (~63.6 FPS).

## Render Cycle Breakdown

| Sub-step | Mean (ms) | % of cycle |
|---|---|---|
| Generated new paint | 5.31 | 32.7% |
| Calculated layout | 4.08 | 25.1% |
| Updated shadow tree | 2.72 | 16.7% |
| — of which: user component code | ~2.50 | ~15.4% |
| — of which: framework reconciliation | ~0.06 | ~0.4% |
| Diffed new paint from current paint | 1.24 | 7.6% |
| Wrote and flushed to output | 0.46 | 2.8% |
| Healed borders | 0.41 | 2.5% |
| Generated instructions from diff | 0.19 | 1.2% |
| Reconciled effects | 0.02 | 0.1% |
| Unaccounted overhead | 1.83 | 11.2% |

**Key insight from `user_code_ns`:** framework reconciliation overhead in the shadow tree
update is ~63µs at the median — effectively nothing. The dominant 2.5ms cost is user
component functions running. This changes the priority of memoization vs. other work.

---

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Skip layout when tree is unchanged (saves ~4 ms/cycle, ~25%)

**Status:** TODO

Layout runs every cycle even though the canvas workload has a completely static component
tree and static styles — no sizing or structural changes ever occur. Adding a dirty flag
(set when styles, structure, or terminal size change) to skip `compute_layout` would
recover the full 4.1 ms on stable frames.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/app.py`, `src/counterweight/layout.py`

---

### 2. Memoize stable component subtrees (saves ~2 ms/cycle, ~12%)

**Status:** TODO

**Revised priority:** now clearly #2, up from #3. `user_code_ns` shows that ~93% of shadow
tree time is spent inside component functions — so skipping calls for unchanged subtrees
would recover most of the 2.5ms. For the canvas workload, `header()` and `fps_display()`
are static each frame and could be skipped entirely. Analogous to `React.memo`.

The opt-in API would likely be a `@component(memo=True)` decorator flag or a `use_memo`
hook. A component would be re-skipped if its args/kwargs are equal to the previous render.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/shadow.py` (`update_shadow`), `src/counterweight/components.py`

---

### 3. Incremental paint for Text nodes (saves ~2–4 ms/cycle, ~15–25%)

**Status:** DONE (user-side optimizations); framework-side incremental paint is N/A

`canvas()` moved to `counterweight.utils` and optimized:
- Coordinate pairs precomputed and cached per `(width, height)` via `_canvas_rows` —
  eliminates 900 temp tuple allocations per call.
- Row-structured iteration replaces flat `enumerate` + `i % width` modulo per cell.
- `_canvas_chunk(fg, bg)` cached via `lru_cache(maxsize=512)` — each unique color pair
  allocated once; subsequent calls return the interned `Chunk`. For the random walkers
  workload (~31 unique pairs), drops canvas allocations from ~1,800 Chunks + 1,800
  CellStyles per frame to ~31 cached objects after warmup.

Framework-side incremental paint is not viable: user components are declarative and return
a new element tree on every render, so the framework has no stable chunk references to diff
against without re-running the component.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/utils.py`

---

### 4. Use lazy initializers in `use_state` (fixed in canvas.py)

**Status:** DONE

`use_state(expensive_expr)` evaluates `expensive_expr` on every render even though the
initial value is only used once. Pass a lambda instead: `use_state(lambda: expensive_expr)`.
`use_state` already supports `Getter[T] | T` — if the argument is callable it is only
invoked on first render.

Fixed in `profiling/canvas.py`: `random.sample(...)` and the walkers list comprehension
are now lambdas.

Also a good pattern to document for framework users.

---

### 5a. Cache `paint_edge()` output (saves est. ~0.5–1 ms/cycle on static layouts)

**Status:** DONE

`paint_edge()` fills margin/padding strips from `(outer, inner, color, z)` arguments — all hashable
(`waxy.Rect` supports value equality, `Color` and `int` are trivially hashable). It does the same
kind of point-by-point iteration as `fill_rect()`, which already has `@lru_cache`. Adding
`@lru_cache(maxsize=2**10)` to `paint_edge()` would make static layouts hit the cache every frame.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/paint.py:145`

---

### 5b. Cache `paint_text()` output (saves est. ~1–2 ms/cycle on static text)

**Status:** DONE

`paint_text()` rebuilds its full `Paint` dict every frame — running `wrap_cells`, `justify_line`,
and dict construction — even when the `Text` element and rect are unchanged. `Text` is a frozen
dataclass (hashable) and `waxy.Rect` supports value equality, so `@lru_cache` keyed on
`(text, rect)` would return the cached dict by reference on subsequent calls.

Note: the cached dict must not be mutated by callers. Currently `paint_element()` merges via
`box | paint_text(...)` which creates a new dict — safe.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/paint.py:111`

---

### 5c. Batch adjacent cells in `paint_to_instructions()` (reduces bytes written)

**Status:** DONE

`paint_to_instructions()` emits one `move_to + SGR + char + reset` per cell (~40 bytes each).
For adjacent cells on the same row with the same style, only one `move_to` and one SGR are needed;
subsequent chars on the same run can be concatenated. Sorting diff cells by `(y, x)` then grouping
same-style runs would reduce output bytes substantially (e.g. a 60-char line of same-style text
goes from ~2400 bytes to ~50 bytes). Impact on write time is modest at current scale but grows
with terminal size or high-churn frames.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/output.py:89`

---

### 6. Narrow border-healing hint set (saves ~0.4 ms/cycle, ~2.5%)

**Status:** TODO / low priority

`hint_cells` is constant at 279 every frame — the same set of cells is inspected every
frame to find the same 5 fixes. The hint set could be derived lazily from the diff output
(only cells adjacent to changed cells need border healing) rather than computed eagerly
from the full layout.

Relevant code: `src/counterweight/paint.py` (border healing logic)

### Run 4 (`paint_edge` cache, `paint_text` cache, batched `paint_to_instructions`)

| Event | Count | Mean | Median | P95 | Max |

Extra metrics (run 4):
- `hint_cells` (border heal): constant 279 every cycle
- `diff_cells` (border heal): constant 5 every cycle
- `diff_cells` (paint diff): mean 207, median 207
- `bytes` written: mean ~8,620 B, median ~8,602 B
- `num_events`: mean 4.1 per cycle
- `num_active_effects`: constant 5

**Result: net regression on the canvas workload (+2.2ms median, 13.7ms → 16.0ms).** The 128ms
instructions spike is a one-time outlier (likely first-call sort). All three changes hurt this workload:

- `paint_text` cache: canvas `Text` content changes every frame → constant cache misses → lru_cache
  lookup overhead with no benefit.
- `paint_edge` cache: probably negligible effect either way (margin/padding rects are static,
  but the work per call is also small).
- Instruction batching (`sorted()` call): adds ~0.175ms/cycle median for the sort overhead on
  ~200 diff cells every frame.

These optimizations benefit static-text workloads (menus, forms, dashboards with stable content)
but are a regression for high-churn workloads like canvas. The right fix for canvas specifically
remains framework-side skip-layout (#1) or component memoization (#2).

Scalene hotspots (run 4, top lines by CPU%):
- `_utils.py:80–91` (flyweight `__new__`) — 3.38% combined, still dominant
- `paint.py:159` — `paint[Position(x, y)] = P(...)` — 0.61%
- `app.py:494` — `new_paint.get(pos, BLANK)` in diff loop — 0.48%
- `output.py:95` — `sorted(paint.items(), ...)` — 0.41% (new cost from batching)
- `layout.py:189` — cell append in wrap_cells — 0.55%

### Extra metrics (run 2)
- `hint_cells` (border heal): constant 279 every cycle
- `diff_cells` (border heal): constant 5 every cycle
- `diff_cells` (paint diff): mean 203
- `bytes` written: mean ~8,544 B
- `num_events`: 4–5 per cycle
- `num_active_effects`: constant 5
